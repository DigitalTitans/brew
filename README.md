I searched, but I couldn't find a Wordpress starter theme that was based on Bootstrap 3 that I liked.  BREW is just pulling together excellent projects such as bootstrap, wordpress, bones, etc into a simple starter theme.  This is very lightweight with only some very mild CSS changes to make everything look nice out of the box.  My goal is to provide a solid foundation for anyone wanting to develop a wordpress theme with bootstrap.
